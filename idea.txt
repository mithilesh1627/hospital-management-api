âœ… Suggested Next Steps

Billing & Payments

Model for invoices, payment methods (cash, card, insurance).

Link bills with appointment_id or patient_id.

Track amount, payment_status, payment_date.

Medical Records

Store patient history, prescriptions, lab results.

Could link with doctor_id + appointment_id.

Authentication & Roles

Use JWT (FastAPI + fastapi-users or custom).

Roles: admin, doctor, staff, patient.

Reports & Analytics

API endpoints for dashboards: number of appointments today, revenue, staff shift summary, etc.

Background Tasks

Email/SMS reminders for upcoming appointments.

Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks or Celery with Redis.
